# ScienceFair2018Scripts
A collection of scripts for various things that I'm saving here to keep my main repository clean.

## Compatibility
The scripts in this project should work with either Python 2.7 or Python 3.x.

## Discontinuation
None of the scripts in this repository are being further developed. Analysis scripts will be put in my LaneDetection repository from now on.
